<h1 id=please-work-it-has-been-a-long-time-since-i-had-some-joy>Please work it has been a long time since i had some joy!</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id=trench-life>Trench Life</h2>
<h1 id=the-everyday-routine>The everyday routine</h1>
<p>When soldiers were not fighting, they lived a rather boring life in the trenches. They rotated duties in front. line trenches which meant that one third of the men were on guard duty while another third repaired the trench and collected food water, letters, ammunition and first aid supplies. The other third would rest. write letters, draw, paint, play cards or cook.</p>
<h1 id=the-monthly-routine>The monthly routine</h1>
<p>In a typical month, a soldier might serve four days in the front-line, four days in a support trench, eight days in the reserve trenches and the remainder of his time behind the lines in the local town. Life in the trenches varied - in some places there was little fighting while in others there were regular attacks and counterattacks. The type and nature of the trenches varied too, depending on the local conditions. For example, the ground around the River Somme in France is chalky and easily dug, but trench sides would crumble easily after it had rained. So, the soldiers would build up the sides with wood and sandbags to keep the trench stable.</p>
<h1 id=trench-homour>Trench Homour</h1>
<p>Some soldiers used humour to cope with the stress they were under. They made up rude songs, told naughty jokes and drew funny pictures and cartoons. The Wipers Times is a good example of this. In 1916, in the bombed-out ruins of the Belgian town of Ypres (pronounced &lsquo;Wipers&rsquo; by British troops), a group of British soldiers found an old printing press and started an &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo; newspaper for the ordinary soldier. At 12 pages long, it was full of funny stories and cartoons, and lots of cleverly disguised criticisms of the senior commanders.</p>
<h1 id=health>Health</h1>
<p>The trenches could be boiling hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. Many soldiers suffered from illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis and diarrhoea. Spending weeks on end with cold, wet feet could lead to trench foot, a painful condition where the foot swells up and develops open sores.</p>
<h1 id=mental-health>Mental Health</h1>
<p>A condition known as shell shock was common. This was caused by the constant fear of death, the relentless noise of the bombs and witnessing close friends being killed in terrible ways. Some people shook uncontrollably while others became paralysed despite suffering no physical injury.</p>
<h1 id=food>Food</h1>
<p>Food was basic: stew, bread and hard biscuits. However, for the soldiers from very poor backgrounds, this was the best they had ever had. Bacon, cheese and jam were treats. The water tasted of chlorine, which killed most germs. British troops received a drink of rum in harsh weather and the Germans drank beer and brandy.</p>
<h1 id=hygiene>Hygiene</h1>
<p>Keeping clean was almost impossible, and almost all soldiers were infested with lice. There were no toilets, so a bucket was used and emptied whenever possible. Rats were a constant problem too, trying to get at food supplies and feeding off the dead corpses in no man&rsquo;s land.</p>
<h1 id=luxuries>Luxuries</h1>
<p>Soldiers looked forward to the arrival of letters and parcels from home. Every week, around 12 million letters and parcels were sent by family, friends and girlfriends. The parcels contained toiletries, tobacco and sweets, for example. The soldiers sent letters home too, but would usually not mention the horrors of trench warfare to avoid upsetting their loved ones. Most letters sent home were first read by a commanding officer, who checked that the contents of the letters did not give away any army secrets or show low morale. This was a precaution taken in case letters were intercepted by the enemy.</p>
<h1 id=stand-to>Stand to</h1>
<p>Soldiers on both sides were up before sunlight for a time known as stand to. They were on their highest state of alert, with guns loaded, and on the lookout for enemy attacks. It was thought that dawn and dusk were the most dangerous times of day because the changing light made it difficult to spot attacks.</p>
<p>What word or phrase does each of these definitions describe? a A time at dawn and dusk when all soldiers were on high alert b A painful condition of the feet caused by prolonged exposure to cold and wet C Mental illness caused by experiences of war 2 Choose five adjectives to describe life in the trenches. For each word, write a sentence or paragraph to explain your choice. 3 Suggest reasons why The Wipers Times was so popular.</p>
