Remember when the URL was clicked. Remember how, because it was in presentation mode the browser of the day (it was IE, letâ€™s be real) played the video behind the Presentation? I do.
I do because said member of staff was then at a loss for several minutes, for me it was an epoch, as to why there was sound but no video.</description></item></channel></rss>
