Surely you cannot be penalised for having been exposed to all things Korea for over 10 years. As soon as the knives and short hair came out I started singing Cry Cry. The cigarette at the wake gave it away. A nice show but too much of a rehash of Tara's Cry Cry in 2011. There are many people jumping on the K drama bandwagon post SG, hopefully this will not lead to a bastardisation of the industry.

The show is good, an unfortunately predictable twist with a good soundtrack (albeit not actually as good as T-ARA's Cry Cry)
