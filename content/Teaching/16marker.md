### So just what are these factors?
They are timeless themes that run throughout our course. It doesn't matter if we are talking about medieval times, early modern, 19th century or the modern era -  factors make an appearance in each one -  When we look at the course as a whole it is clear that some factors make more of an impact and are more prominent in certain time periods than other. So for instance religion is a prominent factor in the Middle Ages, but by the time we reach the 20th century it plays a minimal role.

The reason this is important is that it shows the Second Order Concepts or AO2  of **Change**. What may have been an influencing factor 1000 years ago does not necessarily mean it will be an influencing factor today.  If you are wanting to push for that level 4 that is the highest band in the mark descriptors -  think not only about examples of factors but the prevalence of Factors in certain time periods. Level 4 responses would be able to identify not only the contribution of other factors in the 16 mark question but the relationship between those factors.

### Let’s use an example to illustrate this
One might argue that yes individuals have been important but only because of the funding or action of **governments**. This is a typical response that is used by students, almost exclusively using the example of Edward Jenner. This is a very common response that whilst is good, and on the face of it sounds like a strong level 3 response - a more refined answer might suggest something like this instead. The majority of human history has been pushed forward as a result of the contribution of **individuals** - factors such as **government** have played a role, but have really only coming to play in the last 200 years or so -  and typically they would highlight the Second Reform Act of 1867 which allowed working men to vote as a result for greater **government** action - so politicians could capture their votes. Now this is just one example, but do think about how you can consider not only the role of factors but the relationship that they have with each other.

It would be best if you can draw on examples from across time periods but also have a multitude of examples for each factor. So for instance -- an examiner would not want to read yet another students’  mention of the creation “the NHS of 1948” as an example of **government** action or that the church banned human dissection in the middle ages for that of **religion** - try use this video so you may mention more unique instances in the E of PEA - you can do it!

Remember all of this can be thought of ahead of time- you can have a stock bank of examples and phrases that you are going to use in the exam- as after all the question IS going to ask you to answer using other factors!

Ok - now whilst this is not the exam technique video. The 16 marker requires that you offset one specific **Factor** against the others (offset simply means compare against). For instance a question may ask

_Has the role of the individual been the main factor in developing the treatment of disease in Britain?_ Explain your answer with reference to the role of the individual and other factors.  use a range of examples from across your study of health and the people 1000 AD to present day

Your job will be to compare the role of individuals factor have played in comparison to other factors.  I always tell my students to think of a seesaw. Whatever Factor is given on one end and then I simply line up the other factors and put them on one at a time on the other end of the seesaw.  

If for example I was to throw the government on the opposite end of this question and if the weight was sufficient the  government would go down and individuals would go in the air.  We are looking for the factor that is most chunky. It is imperative then that you offset individuals against the other factors such as the government religion and war. And you are looking for one factor that will force the seesaw into the ground because it’s impact is just so huge!

Another dimension to consider when dealing with abstract terms like factors is the word change - and more specifically - how change occurs.
Do not be a simpleton that says day follows night
Or that at the start of the 19th century there was no government intervention in public health whereas by the end there was substantial.
- It happens at different times
- Different speeds
- And the eventual impact of the change varies
- Look at the images to see, you can see sometimes change is a straight road whereas other times it becomes a long winding path
- The pace can either be rapid like a ball rolling down a hill or it can be slow because of obstacles likes sheep, speed cameras or cyclists   
- When change happens in our course as a result of the influencing factors  that we are going to look at today. (as well previous individuals video in the playlist).

I am going to be covering several examples today so the exact placement on the timeline might be a little off! Regardless it is your job to draw on these examples and make links, depending on the question in the exam!
