So if you want to die you obviously don't give a shit. Like, about anyone. Because if there is anyone who loves you, you don't give a fuck about them, or hurting them, and if there is not, there is no one to give a shit about.
So instead of killing yourself why don't you just get the fuck out? Leave the basement, leave your house, leave at the motherfucking country. Go on an adventure. Spend your time doing something awesome, like tracking down some terrorists. Go be James Bond. Go fuck up a shark with a harpoon. Danger? Fuck that, you were going up against 100% death rate before, you're being safe now. Fuck EVERYTHING, man the world is your oyster.
Sometimes I wish I was suicidal. I've pulled a barrel out of my mouth and point in the air start a revolution, LIVE. Move to Barcelona hit the bars, bang some chicks. STDs, who fucking gives a shit? And then when I'm done, maybe I wouldn't want to kill myself, because I've seen how beautiful the world is"

##  I am not saying
1. That you should kill yourself
1. That I am romanticising suicide
