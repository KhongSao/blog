> - **Key Highlight**::
    - "‘[[Identity politics]]’, meanwhile, has become the place where social justice finds its caucuses. It atomizes society into different interest groups according to sex (or #gender), #race, sexual preference and more. It presumes that such characteristics are the main, or only, relevant attributes of their holders and that they bring with them some added bonus. For example (as the American writer Coleman Hughes has put it), the assumption that there is ‘a heightened moral knowledge’ that comes with being black or female or #gay."
