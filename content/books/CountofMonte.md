This was a long read, set aside a good summer or, let's be honest, a number of hours on Audible (52 to be precise at x1 speed). This was an education in place names - there really are some books that are just off-putting, and I think if I hadn't sped through the first chapter at x2 speed I would have put the book down. All you need to know is that our hero - I believe the term is protagonist if you wish for an extra mark - is called Edmond Dant√©s.
