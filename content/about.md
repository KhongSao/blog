### So I am Chris

On this site you will find my blog pertaining to teaching, society and my experiences

You will also find my notes and musing on a range of books, mostly non fiction

Thoughts and musings on Kdramas will also be discussed in the hope of converting more people away from Western Cinema

If any of the content has been helpful, feel free to [Monzo Me](https://monzo.me/christopheroshea) a coffee

#### I do the following, but not in order or equal amounts

> 1. Pace around school as the person in charge of History
> 1. Speak Chinese with a Tianjin accent
> 1. Drink Trung Nguyen with a Vietnamese phin
> 1. Highlight pdfs or books on Kindle with the intent of making detailed notes
> 1. On the odd occasion I'll make a YouTube video

**If any of the above resonates with you, get in touch**
